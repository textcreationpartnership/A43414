            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Read in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> how that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> preaching to the Jews who had crucified our B. Saviour, he told them indeed roundly of their Fault, and how God had glorified his Son Jeſus, whom they had delivered up and denied before the Face of <hi>Pilate,</hi> he judging him to be releaſed. <hi>But you,</hi> ſay's the H. Apoſtle, <hi>denied the holy and the juſt One, and asked a murtherer to be given unto you: but the Author of Life you killed, whom God has raiſed from the dead:</hi> Yet withal he added, <hi>Now brethren, I know that you did it through ignorance, as did alſo your Princes: Do pennance therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Be not offended if I uſe the freedom to admoniſh you, that by taking the Teſt, you have renounced two Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints;</hi> and have embraced in ſtead of them, two notorious Hereſies: But <hi>I know,</hi> Sir, <hi>you did it through ignorance, as did alſo your Biſhops. Do penance therefore, and be converted, that your ſin may be blotted out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to make you underſtand what you have done, I beſeech you conſider, what a ſad Blot it would be to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and to our Lord Jeſus himſelf, if Invocation of Saints were indeed Idolatrous. That the Son of God ſhould come down from Heaven to eſtabliſh a Church which the Gates of Hell ſhould never prevail againſt, and to teach the right way of Worſhipping the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; and this ſhould be no ſooner peaceably publiſhed to the World, as it was in the time of <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> but its prime Doctors, eminent for Sanctity and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould become groſs Idolaters, and ſhould ſo continue for 1300 years together, and profeſs and prove to all the World, that their Lord Jeſus, who was gone to Heaven,
<pb facs="tcp:58286:3"/>had confirmed their Idolatry by a thouſand Miracles, if any Credit can be given to as Authentic Records as can poſſibly be made by Men; and which there is no means left to confute, but the bare groundleſs Aſſeverations of their Accuſers, that they are Forgeries. Who in his right Wits could rationally be a Chriſtian, if theſe things were ſo; but ought not rather to go on, and accuſe the Holy Evangeliſts themſelves alſo of Forgery, and impudently deny all the Miracles recounted by them, to have been wrought by our Bleſſed Lord himſelf? For Chriſtianity ſake therefore, Worthy Sir, do not aſſert Invocation of Saints to be Idolatrous. But have then the moſt eminent Chriſtian Doctors for Learning and Sanctity, as ſoon as Chriſtianity was peaceably and publickly profeſs'd in the World, taught and practis'd Invocation of Saints? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more certain. Conſult our Controvertiſts, and you cannot doubt it. Take a Teſtimony or two of ſome few Chriſtian Doctors, whom I am ſure (ſuch is your Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at leaſt for the Primitive Fathers of the firſt 600 years) you will bluſh to accuſe of Idolatry. <hi>S. Chryſoſtom, Hom.</hi> 66. <hi>ad Populum, circa finem. He who is clothed in Purple comes and embraces their Sepulchers, and laying aſide his Pomp ſtands making Supplication to the Saints, that they would intercede for him to God; and he who is crowned with a Diadem, beſeeches the Tent-maker and the Fiſherman to be his Protectors.</hi> S. Ambroſe, lib. de Viduis. <hi>The Angels ought to be entreated, who are given us for our ſafeguard; the Martyrs ought to be prayed unto, &amp;c.</hi> S. Hierom in Epitaphio Paulae. <hi>Farewell, O</hi> Paula, <hi>and help with thy Prayers the extream old age of thy Worſhipper.</hi> Like Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies are to be ſeen at large in <hi>Ballarmin</hi> out of S. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil, Orat. in</hi> 40 <hi>Martyres;</hi> S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, Orat. in Cyprianum;</hi> S. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen, Orat. in S. Theodorum;</hi> S. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrem, Serm. de laudibus S. Martyrum;</hi> S. <hi>Prudentius in Carmine de S.

            <pb facs="tcp:58286:3"/>
            <p> At leaſt, for the firſt Pretended-Reformers ſake, do not ſay 'tis Idolatry to pray to Saints. <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> the Head of Novel Proteſtants, ſays, The Devil, in a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence he had with him, taught him, that to Invocate the B. Virgin, was to deprive God of his Honor. A Doctrin indeed worthy of ſuch an Author. Another Pretended-Reformer, Mr. <hi>Latimer,</hi> gives us his Sentiment concerning Invocation of Saints, in the following words. <hi>Firſt, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are called Saints, and ſo they are not to be worſhipped, taking worſhipping of them for praying to them: for they are neither Mediators by way of Redemption, nor yet by way of Interceſſion. And yet they may be well uſed when they are applied to that uſe that they were ordained for, to be Laymens Books, for remembrance of Heavenly things, &amp;c. Take Saints for Inhabiters of Heaven, and Worſhipping of them for Praying to them, I never denied but that they might be worſhipped, and be our Mediators, though not by way of Redemption (for ſo Chriſt alone is a whole Mediator both for them and us) yet by way of Interceſſion.</hi> Fox Mart. Tom. 3. p. 464. A.D. 1555. <hi>And I denied not but that we may well ſay,</hi> Ave Maria, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ibid. The Compilers of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Common-Prayer Book teach to pray thus. <hi>Command theſe our Prayers and Supplications, by the miniſtry of thy Holy Angels, to be brought up into thy Holy Tabernacle, before the ſight of thy Divine Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If not for the firſt Pretended-Reformers, at leaſt for the Sentiment of divers of the moſt Learned of your Clergy of the preſent Age, be not ſo ſevere. Dr. <hi>Forbes,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in his <hi>Pacifical Conſiderations,</hi> ſays, <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints is neither unlawful nor unprofitable.</hi> And the late Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> thought it unreaſonable ſolemnly to abjure Doctrins about which Learned Men diſpute: And himſelf told me, he did not think Advocation of Saints, or a ſingle Petition to the Saints to pray for us to be Idolatrous; but only Invocation, that is, a calling upon them with a Faith in them, as Gods, according to that of S. <hi>Paul, How ſhall they invocate him in whom they have not
<pb facs="tcp:58286:4"/>believed?</hi> Now what Roman-Catholic invocates Saints believing them to be Gods? Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> alſo, late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> told me himſelf, That though he did not approve of Invocation of Saints, yet he did not think it Idolatry. And the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the Scholars of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> in his Manual of Devotions for that School, to Invocate the whole Court of Heaven. Hear his own Words. <hi>Help me then, O ye Bleſſed Hoſt of Heaven, to celebrate that unknown Sorrow, that wonderful Love, which you your ſelves ſo much admire: Help me to praiſe my Crucified Saviour.</hi> Pag. 39. So that all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference now betwixt S. <hi>Omars</hi> and <hi>Wincheſters</hi> School is, if they follow their Doctor's Advice; The Scholars of S. <hi>Omars</hi> pray, <hi>Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>pray for us; S.</hi> Peter, <hi>pray for us; S.</hi> Paul, <hi>pray for us, &amp;c.</hi> The Scholars of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> all at once pray, <hi>The whole Court of Heaven help us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If for none of theſe Regards, at leaſt for Common Senſe ſake, do not ſay 'tis Chriſtian Devotion to deſire Holy Men to pray for you whilſt they live with you upon Earth, though at a thouſand Miles diſtance from you, and proteſt it's groſs Idolatry to deſire the ſame Good Men to pray for you when they live with God in Heaven.</p>
            <p>I omit the Teſtimony of the preſent Chriſtians in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe I know you have a prejudice againſt them. Only I deſire you would in your private thoughts impartially conſider their Number, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Study of H. Scriptures, Ancient Fathers, Chriſtian Councils, Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſolid Piety as to vaſt numbers of them; and reflect if ſuch vaſt numbers of Learned and pious Doctors, and as to all <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whoſe temporal Intereſt it would be to have other Sentiments, after all their Prayer, Diſputes, Study, and Holy living, are ſtupid groſs Idolaters, who may probably hope ever to come to the knowledge of the Truth in Matters of Religion?</p>
            <p>In fine, If neither for Chriſt Jeſus and Chriſtianities ſake, nor for the moſt eminent Primitive and Modern Chriſtian Doctors ſake, nor for the firſt and preſent Pretended-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58286:4"/>formers ſake neither; at leaſt for Reverence to His preſent Sacred Majeſty <hi>JAMES the Second,</hi> whom God long preſerve, be not ſo ſevere as to condemn Invocation of Saints as Idolatrous: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humbly ſupplicate His Royal Concurrence to aboliſh that Teſt, which was not deviſed out of Conſcience, by the Loyal Church of <hi>England,</hi> to promote Chriſtian Piety; but out of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by the Party, to ruin all truly Loyal Subjects, as well of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as time has too manifeſtly proved. I remember to have heard, that one Dr. <hi>Young,</hi> giving this Queſtion for his Divinity-Act in the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Cambridge, That Bowing towards the Altar was Idolatrous;</hi> Dr. <hi>Martyn</hi> diſputed thus againſt him: <hi>If Genuflexion towards the Altar be Idolatrous, then when the King bows towards the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, he is an Idolater: But when the King bows towards the Altar, he is not an Idolater: Therefore Genuflexion towards the Altar is not Idolatrous.</hi> The Puritan Faction ſaid, it was a peeviſh Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But no doubt the Diſcourſe did rightly conclude. And 'tis no leſs concluſive; If Invocation of Saints be Idolatry, then when His Sacred Majeſty Invocates Saints, He is an Idolater. That <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>-men ſhould revile His Sacred Majeſty, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: but that a truly Loyal Parliament, ſuch as by the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God this preſent is, of which you are a Worthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhould tell his Sacred Majeſty in His Royal Preſence, <hi>That He is the blackeſt of Criminals, an Idolater;</hi> and ſolemnly proteſt in the word of a Chriſtian, that they ſay nothing but the very Truth; This, methinks, is ſo amazing and ſo aſtoniſhing, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more. For you muſt know, Worthy Sir, That to burn the Royal City of <hi>London</hi> to Aſhes, to murther Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfrey, Eſſex, Ruſſel,</hi> His own Sacred Brother, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more, tho' never ſo innocent, according to true Divinity, are Petty-larcencies, compar'd with the horrid Sacrilege of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>But, Sir I muſt end as I began: <hi>Wherefore do penance and be converted, that your ſin may be pardoned you: for I know you did it through ignorance, as did alſo your Biſhops.</hi> The All-merciful Jeſus forgive you, and his H. Mother and all his Saints pray for you, as do's</p>

            <p>THat Superiors ſhould chaſtiſe with due Correction thoſe who are under their Charge, for diſobeying their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, nothing is more uſual, nor nothing more equitable: But that Superiors ſhould ſeverely puniſh their Subjects for doing what they bid them do, and tell them they are obliged in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and under pain of Damnation for to do, is a Tyranny as unjuſt, as unheard of. Conformiſts tell Diſſenters and Roman-Catholics, They are not to ſubmit their Judgments to their Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but after they have heard what they have to ſay from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Scripture for their Faith or Morals, they teach, If, after all, in their own private Judgments they are firmly perſwaded what they teach is not according to Scripture or Reaſon, they are bound in Conſcience, under pain of Damnation, to follow their own laſt proper Judgment of Diſcretion, and not to ſubmit their Sentiments to the Judgment of them their Superiors: And yet for doing thus, as they command them to do, and ſay they are obliged to do, they deprive them of their Birthrights, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon their Perſons, and ſeiſe their Eſtates. This, Honored Sir, if Paſſion would give you leave ſeriouſly to reflect on, you would manifeſtly ſee is a Tyranny and Cruelty beyond that of <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Diocletian. Nero</hi> ſeverely puniſhed Chriſtians, but it was for diſobeying his Commands; you ſeverely puniſh Chriſtians for religiouſly obſerving your Commands. 'Tis the Glory, you ſay, of your Church, to permit all Chriſtians freely to examin her, Dogms, and after they have heard her, as freely to follow their own proper laſt Judgment of Diſcretion: Nor do we envy you this Glory; no, we thank you for it; we willingly follow your Advice, we impartially examin your particular and proper Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins; and after all, our laſt Judgment of Diſcretion is, That they are abſolute Hereſies; and you deprive us of our Birthright, for this our Judgment: And this, we think, we have reaſon to complain of.</p>
